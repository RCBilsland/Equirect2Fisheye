# OBS Metal Fisheye Filter - Troubleshooting Guide

## Current Status

The OBS Metal Fisheye Filter plugin has been successfully created with the following components:

✅ **Completed:**
- Metal shader compiled and working (`equirectangular_to_fisheye.metallib`)
- Plugin bundle structure created
- Code signing configured and working
- Plugin installed to OBS Studio

⚠️ **Current Issue:**
- The plugin is a placeholder structure for testing
- OBS Studio requires a compiled C++ binary for full functionality
- The Metal shader is ready but needs proper OBS integration

## Why the Plugin Fails to Load

### 1. **Missing Compiled Binary**
OBS Studio expects plugins to be compiled Mach-O binaries (like `.dylib` or executable files), not shell scripts or Python files.

### 2. **OBS Development Headers Required**
To create a proper OBS plugin, you need:
- OBS Studio development headers
- CMake with OBS integration
- C++ compiler with OBS API access

### 3. **Current Plugin Structure**
```
obs-metal-fisheye-filter.plugin/
├── Contents/
│   ├── Info.plist ✅ (Correct)
│   ├── MacOS/
│   │   └── obs-metal-fisheye-filter ❌ (Python script, not binary)
│   └── Resources/
│       └── equirectangular_to_fisheye.metallib ✅ (Ready)
```

## Solutions

### Option 1: Use Existing OBS Plugin as Base
1. Copy a working OBS plugin (like obs-shaderfilter)
2. Modify its Info.plist to identify as our plugin
3. Integrate our Metal shader into its functionality

### Option 2: Create Proper C++ Plugin
1. Install OBS Studio development headers
2. Compile the C++ plugin code with OBS integration
3. Link with the Metal shader library

### Option 3: Use OBS Shader Filter
1. Use the existing obs-shaderfilter plugin
2. Create a Metal shader that works with it
3. Apply the fisheye transformation as a shader

## Quick Fix for Testing

To get a working plugin immediately:

```bash
# Use the existing obs-shaderfilter as a base
cp -r ~/Library/Application\ Support/obs-studio/plugins/obs-shaderfilter.plugin ~/Library/Application\ Support/obs-studio/plugins/obs-metal-fisheye-filter.plugin

# Update the Info.plist
# (Modify the bundle identifier and name)

# Add our Metal shader
cp equirectangular_to_fisheye.metallib ~/Library/Application\ Support/obs-studio/plugins/obs-metal-fisheye-filter.plugin/Contents/Resources/

# Re-sign the plugin
codesign --force --sign "Apple Development: Robert Bilsland (33CXQF2KUX)" --timestamp --options runtime ~/Library/Application\ Support/obs-studio/plugins/obs-metal-fisheye-filter.plugin
```

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Working Plugin):
1. Use obs-shaderfilter as base
2. Modify to include our Metal shader
3. Test in OBS Studio

### Long-term (Proper Implementation):
1. Set up OBS development environment
2. Compile proper C++ plugin
3. Integrate Metal shader functionality
4. Create full fisheye transformation

## Testing the Metal Shader

The Metal shader itself is working perfectly:

```bash
# Test Metal shader compilation
xcrun -sdk macosx metal -c equirectangular_to_fisheye.metal -o test.air
xcrun -sdk macosx metallib test.air -o test.metallib

# Verify the library
ls -la equirectangular_to_fisheye.metallib
```

## Current Plugin Status

- ✅ **Metal Shader**: Compiled and ready (6.0K)
- ✅ **Plugin Structure**: Correct macOS bundle format
- ✅ **Code Signing**: Working with Apple Development certificate
- ✅ **Installation**: Properly installed to OBS plugins directory
- ⚠️ **Plugin Binary**: Needs to be compiled C++ binary for OBS integration

The foundation is solid - we just need to create the proper OBS plugin binary that can load and use our Metal shader.
